# SentimentalAnalysis_NLP
Sentimental Analysis using NLP
The project appears to be related to sentiment analysis of tweets directed at airlines. The dataset contains various fields, including "tweet_id," "airline_sentiment," "airline_sentiment_confidence," "negativereason," "negativereason_confidence," "airline," and more. These fields likely store information about tweets, their sentiment (positive, negative, neutral), and additional details like confidence scores, reasons for negative sentiment, and user-related data.

The project's primary objective is likely to perform sentiment analysis on tweets to assess how customers feel about different airlines. This analysis can help airlines and related businesses understand customer satisfaction, identify areas for improvement, and respond to negative feedback more effectively. The project may involve natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to classify sentiment, as well as data visualization and reporting for insights.
